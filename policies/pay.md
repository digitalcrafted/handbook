# Pay

## Payday

If you are an employee in the US, you will be paid biweekly on Friday for the period that ends on the previous Sunday. If you are an employee outside of the US, you will be paid monthly on the 25th of the month, for the preceding month.

If a payday falls on a nonworking day, employees will be paid the preceding workday.

Please review your paycheck for errors. If you find an error, report it to [management@thoughtbot.com](mailto:management@thoughtbot.com) immediately.

## Direct Deposit

Your pay will be deposited into your bank account through our direct deposit program. To edit your direct deposit information, use [Namely][namely]. Everyone who needs to know will be alerted when you do that.

## Payroll System

For US employees, we use [ViewPayroll][viewpayroll-link]. You can use it to view your pay stubs, pay dates, and W2/1099, and paycheck deductions (e.g. 401K). If you do not know your username/password for this, please [email benefits](mailto:benefits@thoughtbot.com).

For employees outside of the US, we do not have payroll online. Please email [management@thoughtbot.com](mailto:management@thoughtbot.com) if you have questions about your payroll.

## Paycheck Deductions

The company is required by law to make certain deductions from your paycheck each pay period. Such deductions typically include federal and state taxes and Social Security (FICA) taxes. Depending on the state in which you are employed and the benefits you choose, there may be additional deductions. All deductions and the amount of the deductions are listed on your pay stub. These deductions are totaled each year for you on your Form W-2, Wage and Tax Statement.

It is the policy of the company that exempt (salaried) employees' pay will not be “docked,” or subject to deductions, in violation of salary pay rules issued by the United States Department of Labor and any corresponding rules issued by the state government, as applicable. However, the company may make deductions from employees' salaries in a way that is permitted under federal and state wage and hour rules. Employees will be reimbursed in full for any isolated, inadvertent, or improper deductions, as defined by law.

Thus, exempt employees may be subject to the following salary deductions, except where prohibited by state law, but only for the following reasons:

* Absences of one or more full days for personal reasons, other than sickness or disability; or
* Absences of one or more full days due to sickness or disability, if there is a plan, policy, or practice providing replacement compensation for such absences; or
* Absences of one or more full days before eligibility under such a plan, policy, or practice or after replacement compensation for such absences has been exhausted; or
* Suspensions of one or more full days for violations of safety rules of major significance; or
* Suspensions of one or more full days for violations of written workplace conduct rules, such as rules against sexual harassment and workplace violence; or
* Payment of actual time worked in the first and last weeks of employment, resulting in a proportional rate of an employee's full salary; or
* Any unpaid leave taken under the Family and Medical Leave Act; or
* Negative paid-time-off balances, in whole-day increments only.

## Garnishment / Child Support

When an employee's wages are garnished by a court order, our company is legally bound to withhold the amount indicated in the garnishment order from the employee's paycheck. Our company will, however, honor federal and applicable state guidelines that protect a certain amount of an employee's income from being subject to garnishment.

## Overtime

Our goal is to work sustainably and we are committed to a 40 hour work week. Overtime should be extremely rare, and must be approved by your manager.

In the rare circumstances where a client project prompts overtime, you should take paid time off equal to the amount of overtime worked, as promptly as possible following the overtime.

The above does not apply for non-exempt employees, and local regulations may forbid the above policy of compensatory time. In such cases, the employee will be paid overtime in accordance with local regulations.
