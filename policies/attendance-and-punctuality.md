# Attendance and Punctuality

Attendance and punctuality are important factors for your success within our company. We work as a team and this requires that each person be in the right place at the right time.

If you are going to be late for work or absent, notify the operations team by emailing <admin@thoughtbot.com>, and the rest of your team, as far in advance as is feasible under the circumstances.

Personal issues requiring time away from work should be scheduled during your nonworking hours, if possible.

## Business Hours

Our normal business hours are 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., Monday through Friday.

## Working Hours

You may set your own working hours, as long as your obligations to the company and clients are met. Communicate with your team about what your schedule will be, and once you have establish a regular working schedule, let the rest of your team know if you'll be deviating from it.

You are expected to attend your office's daily stand-up meeting.

## Contact with the Company

The operations team should know your location at all times during business hours, and should be notified of your whereabouts outside the company during working hours.

If you are absent for three days without notifying the company, it is assumed that you have voluntarily abandoned your position with the company, and you will be removed from the payroll. Under such circumstances, we will terminate your health insurance as of your last working day.
