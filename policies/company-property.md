## Care of Company Property

Use your best judgement when using the company's property and equipment. If any company property is lost or damaged, report it to admin@thoughtbot.com. The company may require that you pay all or part of the cost of replacement or repair.

Company property may include laptop and desktop computers, peripherals, cell phones, telephones, printers, scanners, fax machines, office keys/alarm codes and intellectual property.

All company property dispensed to you becomes your responsibility. If your employment is terminated or if the company requests that the property be returned for any reason, then you have 7 calendar days to return the equipment in good condition. If the property is not returned, the company may take action to recover its losses, up to and including legal action.

## Intellectual Property

All software, concepts, development and completed projects are the property of the company or our clients.
